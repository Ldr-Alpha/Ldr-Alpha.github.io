  <p>Hi, my name is Rodimus, I name myself usually as <strong><sup style ="color:darkgray;">Ldr </sup>alpha<sub>-</sub></strong>. I am a 13 year old boy.</p>
  <p>I was born in Hongkong at July 8, 2009, 8:25pm. My head was way bigger than the infants there when i was born and my mom said i would be extra smart (which there's proof that's not true). My daily hobbies are playing the piano and skateboarding at the local skatepark.</p>
  <h2 style="color:darkgray;" ><b>Skate<sub>Board</sub></b></h2>
  <p>  One of my favorite hobbies is skateboarding. I have skateboarded for 1 and a 1/2 years and can do a fair amount of tricks. One of my goals is to learn the Hardflip, which is one of my favorite tricks all time in skateboard. </p>
